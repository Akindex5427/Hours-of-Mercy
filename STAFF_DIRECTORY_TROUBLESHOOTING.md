# StaffDirectory Troubleshooting Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Motion Component Issues**

- Removed complex Framer Motion animations that could cause rendering failures
- Replaced `MotionCard` and `MotionBox` with regular `Card` and `Box` components
- Fixed all JSX closing tag mismatches

### 2. **Loading State Issues**

- Added timeout mechanism (10 seconds) to prevent infinite loading
- Enhanced debug logging to track component state
- Improved loading UI with descriptive text

### 3. **Error Handling**

- Added visible error alerts for users
- Firebase errors now show but don't block rendering
- Fallback to static data when Firebase fails

### 4. **Debug Features Added**

- Console logging for Firebase state (`staff`, `loading`, `error`)
- Visual loading indicator with text
- Error messages displayed to users

## Changes Made:

### Code Changes:

1. **Import Updates**: Added React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`)
2. **Timeout Logic**: Added `forceShowContent` state with 10-second timer
3. **Simplified Components**: Removed Framer Motion animations
4. **Enhanced Error Display**: Added Alert component for Firebase errors
5. **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive console logging

### Files Modified:

- `src/pages/StaffDirectory.jsx` - Main component with all fixes

### Files Removed:

- `src/pages/StaffDirectoryTest.jsx` - Test component (deleted)
- `src/pages/StaffDirectorySimple.jsx` - Simple version (deleted)

## Testing Instructions:

### 1. **Check Browser Console**

Open Developer Tools (F12) â†’ Console tab and look for:

```
StaffDirectory Debug: { staff: [...], loading: false, error: null, forceShowContent: false }
```

### 2. **Expected Behaviors**

- **Loading State**: Shows spinner for max 10 seconds
- **Error State**: Shows red alert but continues with static data
- **Success State**: Shows Firebase data or falls back to static data

### 3. **Static Data Available**

Even if Firebase fails, you should see these staff members:

- Peter Olawale Sunday (Senior Pastor)
- Pastor Mary Johnson (Associate Pastor)
- Pastor David Wilson (Youth Pastor)
- Minister Sarah Davis (Worship Leader)
- James Thompson (Administrative Assistant)
- Susan Miller (Children's Ministry Coordinator)

## Next Steps:

1. **Test the page** - Navigate to `/staff` and check console
2. **If still blank** - Check for JavaScript errors in console
3. **If Firebase issues** - Check if other Firebase features work (newsletter, prayer requests)
4. **If animations needed** - Can re-add Framer Motion gradually after basic functionality works

## Quick Test:

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/staff` and you should see:

- Either a loading spinner (max 10 seconds)
- Or the staff directory with at least 6 staff members
- Console logs showing the component state

The page should NO LONGER show a blank/white screen!
